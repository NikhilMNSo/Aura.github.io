    <h1><b>Why AURA</b></h1>
    <p> Imagine experiencing a sudden medical emergency while away from home, rendered unconscious due to an underlying
        health condition. In this critical scenario, valuable time could be lost while healthcare professionals scramble
        to gather your medical history, allergies, and medication information. This delay in diagnosis and treatment can
        have significant consequences, potentially impacting the effectiveness of interventions and even jeopardizing
        your life.</p>
</div>
<div class="how">
    <h1>How it works</h1>

It offers doctors a comprehensive summary of your medical background in the critical "golden hour," ensuring swift and accurate treatment without starting from scratch.
